## Overview

## My process

Similar to other projects I used the design images to build a mock up of the structure I need to apply to ensure a semantic markup and layout. This will be my first time building an accodian from scratch so this will require some research on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

#### What I learned

In this project I have learned that using both the "details" and " summary" elements reduces
the code needed for this pattern.
